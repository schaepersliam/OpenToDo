# OpenToDo
Hey!
My name is Liam and I am the creator of this project. This will be(I guess)the first fully open-source Android ToDo list
and everyone can help create it. It doesn't matter if you code in Java or Kotlin(if you code in Kotlin please see details below).
If you are intersted in helping growing this project, clone the repository to your computer and start coding :)
It would be awesome if you share this project with your friends! :)

Big thank you

Liam

## Coding in Kotlin
If you would like to code in Kotlin, no problem! There is only one thing you have to do when creating a pull request. Please convert
your code in Kotlin to Java with the build in converter in Android Studio. 
If you need help doing this check [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-kotlin#convert-to-kotlin-code) out.
Big thank you again for helping growing this project! :)

## Create a pull request
So, you have made your improvements to the code and want to create a pull request? Nothing easier than that.
Just one thing to remember when doing this. Please add a full description on what you have changed and explain how it works(e.g. if
you have implemented a new feature). Note that I will read every single pull request and hopefully accept them. However I preffer
pull request that include:
- A solution to a problem/bug you've found
- A new feature
- A done ToDo(see below)

Please test your improvement(s) or new feature(s) carefully.
If you want to do design improvements or a complete new design of the app, please create a pull request. But please se the notes
to that below first.

Thank you for creating a pull request and helping growing the project. :)

## Design(-improvements)
You're an App Designer and want to help growing this project? Awesome! My design skills are very limited so I apprechiate that very much.
Before doing a pull request please check if you have done all of the following:
- [x] All ID's in the layout file mathing the linked ID's in the other code.
- [x] Your design is based on [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/)
- [x] Your design looks awesome :)

## Things ToDo
Here are all things needed to do(you'll find them in the todo section in Android Studio too):

- Currently nothig. Add something if you want to improve the app! :)

If you want to add something on the todo list just make a pull request with the updated README.
The same goes for working on a todo. If you would like to work on a todo make a pull request and add your GitHub name
after the todo, like I did.

## Coder of this project
Here are all coder's of this project listed. If you also want to be on this list just make an awesome change/improvement to the project.
